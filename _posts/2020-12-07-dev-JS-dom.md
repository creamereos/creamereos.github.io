### DOM

The Document Object Model (a.k.a. the DOM) Is a **Hierarchy/Tree of JavaScript Node Objects**

When you write an HTML document, you encapsulate HTML content inside other HTML content. By doing this, you set up a hierarchy that can be expressed as a tree.

```html
<body>
    <section>
        <div>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </section>
</body>
```

The preceding HTML code, when parsed by a browser, creates a document that contains nodes structured in a tree format (i.e., DOM). 

HTML documents get parsed by a browser and converted into a tree structure of node objects representing a live document. **The purpose of the DOM is to provide a programmatic interface for scripting (removing, adding, replacing, eventing, and modifying)** this live document using JavaScript.

### node type

- DOCUMENT_NODE (e.g., window.document)
- ELEMENT_NODE (e.g., <body>, <a>, <p>, <script>, <style>, <html>, <h1>)
- ATTRIBUTE_NODE (e.g., class="funEdges")
- TEXT_NODE (e.g., text characters in an HTML document including carriage returns and whitespace)
- DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE (e.g., document.createDocumentFragment()) 
- DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE (e.g., <!DOCTYPE html>)
- etc...


### Subnode Objects Inherit From the Node Object

- Object < Node < Element < HTMLElement < (e.g., HTML*Element) 
- Object < Node < Attr (this is deprecated in DOM4)
- Object < Node < CharacterData < Text
- Object < Node < Document < HTMLDocument
- Object < Node < DocumentFragment

Itâ€™s important to remember **not only that all node types inherit from Node, but also that the chain of inheritance can be long.**w For example, all HTMLAnchorElement nodes inherit properties and methods from HTMLElement, Element, Node, and Object objects.
